NOTES

Continuous commands accept values between -1 and 1.

Discrete commands accept only integers (0, 1, or -1).

Commands only work after the mission has fully begun.

Most commands require specific handlers in the mission XML.

moveVertical only works in creative/flying agent modes.

Commands are not persistent; you must send them again if needed.
