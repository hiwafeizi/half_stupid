# half_stupid
half_stupid is an experimental project where we try to build the closest functional approximation of a mind using the theories we have in cognitive science and neuroscience.
The agents live inside Minecraft and begin with almost nothing: minimal abilities, simple basic needs, and no predefined understanding of the world.
From there, we explore how more complex behavior, decision making, and patterns of cognition can emerge from simple foundations when placed in a rich environment.

This project is not meant to be a full brain simulation.
It is an open attempt to apply real cognitive principles in practice and see what kind of agent behavior naturally develops.
We welcome new ideas, different perspectives, and any contributions that help us get closer to a mind-like system.
