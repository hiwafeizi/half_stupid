# ⭐ **Core Brain Components You Need (Complete List)**

## **1. Perception System (Vision)**

Converts the world into structured features.

* local grid
* nearby objects/entities
* danger cues
* novelty cues

Absolutely essential.

---

## **2. Drives / Internal Needs**

These create all motivation:

* hunger
* safety
* curiosity
* comfort (optional but useful)
* social need (stay near others)

Without drives, nothing makes sense.

---

## **3. Emotion System**

Emotions are numerical states that come from drives + outcomes:

* valence (good–bad)
* arousal (calm–alert)
* fear
* comfort

Emotions allow events to have meaning.

---

## **4. **Short-Term Memory** (Working Memory) **

This is **crucial** and cannot be skipped.

Short-term memory stores:

* what just happened
* what the agent is currently doing
* last few perceptions
* temporary goals
* temporary thoughts

It acts as the “scratchpad” for current thinking.

Without this, planning is impossible.

---

## **5. Long-Term Memory (Episodic Memory)**

Stores past experiences:

```
(situation, action, outcome, emotion)
```

Used for:

* learning
* avoiding past mistakes
* repeating good behaviors

---

## **6. Semantic / Valence Memory**

This stores cumulative emotional meaning:

* place → average emotion
* object → average emotion
* agent → average emotion
* event → emotional pattern

This is how they “like” or “hate” things.

---

## **7. Spatial Memory**

A map of:

* where they have been
* which places are good or bad
* where food was found
* where danger happened

This gives them a sense of “world”.

---

## **8. Fast Thought System (System 1)**

Runs constantly.

* reflexes
* immediate reactions
* simple decisions
* movement
* basic exploration

Small, cheap neural net or rules.

---

## **9. Slow Thought System (System 2)**

Runs occasionally.

* deeper thinking
* evaluating memory
* adjusting goals
* updating preferences
* forming “intentions”

Outputs **biases**, not specific actions.

---

## **10. Planning / Intent Module**

This is NOT a full planner.
It’s a simple system that:

* picks a **goal direction**
* adjusts action tendencies
* selects memory targets
* connects emotions to future choices

Essential for higher cognition.

---

## **11. Associative Learning System**

This links:

* events ↔ emotions
* objects ↔ outcomes
* places ↔ feelings
* agents ↔ valence

This is how meaning forms naturally.

---

## **12. Behavior / Action Selector**

Combines:

* fast reactions
* slow intentions
* emotions
* drives
* memories

And chooses one **generic action**:

* walk
* turn
* explore
* interact
* follow
* flee
* rest

This keeps everything emergent.

---

# ⭐ **Optional but Useful**

These are not essential for Brain v1 but will matter later.

## **13. Sound Production (for language emergence)**

Just generic signals.

## **14. Pointing / Attention Sharing**

Critical for emergent communication later.

## **15. Social Bias Module**

A tiny system that makes them prefer being near others.

---

# ⭐ **Final Essential List (Absolutely needed)**

To summarize the **minimum full brain model** that still feels mind-like:

1. Perception
2. Drives
3. Emotion
4. Short-term memory
5. Long-term memory
6. Valence memory
7. Spatial memory
8. Fast thought
9. Slow thought
10. Planning / intent
11. Associative learning
12. Action selector
