half_stupid to do



## **1. Define the Cognitive Model (Research Phase)**

Before coding anything, we need to understand what we want to simulate.

Research topics:

* basic brain systems (homeostasis, emotion, memory, habits)
* functions of amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex
* developmental psychology (how infants learn without language)
* symbol grounding and emergent communication
* simple reinforcement learning and animal learning theory

Outcome:

* a document describing each “brain region” and the simplified function we will implement.

---

## **2. Design the Agent Architecture**

Translate the research into a workable structure.

Define:

* perception module
* drives and needs
* emotional system
* fast instinct system (amygdala-like)
* slow planning system (prefrontal-like)
* episodic memory
* procedural memory (habits)
* naming system
* communication channel
* pointing mechanism
* reward structure

Outcome:

* a blueprint showing how each module connects and what data flows between them.

---

## **3. Build the Environment Interface**

Choose how the agent interacts with the world.

Work:

* connect to Minecraft (MineDojo, Malmo, or custom API)
* define what the agent can observe
* define what actions the agent can take
* decide what sensory information the agent receives (no labels)

Outcome:

* the agent can *see* and *act* in the world.

---

## **4. Implement Perception + State Encoding**

Convert Minecraft world data into useable signals.

Tasks:

* extract spatial grid around the agent
* encode blocks without labels
* encode entities as shapes/motion patterns
* encode light, danger, noise
* create a stable vector representation of “the world right now”

Outcome:

* the agent receives structured sensory data but no concepts.

---

## **5. Implement Drives and Homeostasis**

Create the internal needs that push behavior.

Drives:

* hunger
* safety
* curiosity
* energy
* comfort

Each drive changes over time.
Each drive influences behavior.

Outcome:

* the agent has internal motivation.

---

## **6. Implement Emotion Module**

Define emotional states based on drives and events.

Examples:

* fear
* excitement
* boredom
* seeking
* frustration

Outcome:

* actions are biased by emotional state.

---

## **7. Implement Fast System (Instincts)**

A small neural network for:

* danger reaction
* avoiding threats
* quick survival choices

Outcome:

* the agent can respond instantly without thinking.

---

## **8. Implement Slow System (Planning)**

A deeper network (or simple planner) that uses:

* memory
* emotion
* drives
* sensory input

This system chooses:

* exploration
* foraging
* resting
* long-term behavior

Outcome:

* the agent can plan beyond instincts.

---

## **9. Build the Memory System**

Three layers:

* **episodic memory** (what happened, where)
* **semantic memory** (facts discovered over time)
* **procedural memory** (habits, routines)

Outcome:

* the agent forms stable internal representations.

---

## **10. Implement Naming / Symbol Grounding**

When the agent sees something new:

* generates its own label
* attaches the label to sensory features
* updates dictionary over time

Outcome:

* the agent develops its own vocabulary.

---

## **11. Add Pointing & Communication**

Agents can:

* point at something
* speak a symbol
* align meanings
* teach each other labels

Outcome:

* shared proto-language begins to emerge.

---

## **12. Multi-Agent Behavior**

Introduce multiple agents with:

* shared memory opportunities
* conflicting needs
* cooperation or competition potential

Outcome:

* culture-like patterns may emerge.

---

## **13. Training and Experimentation**

Test different:

* reward functions
* drive weightings
* personalities
* environments
* communication protocols

Outcome:

* observe emergent behavior and refine the model.

---

## **14. Documentation and Research Notes**

Document:

* what worked
* what changed
* what emerged
* unexpected patterns

Outcome:

* the project becomes a research platform, not just code.

---

## **15. Iterative Improvement**

Based on results, refine:

* brain-module models
* memory
* perception
* communication
* reward shaping

Outcome:

* closer and closer approximation to mind-like behavior.
