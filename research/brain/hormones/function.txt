# Hormone Function

Functionality:
- Coordinate and regulate physiological processes to maintain homeostasis and respond to environmental changes

What affects it:
- Target tissue sensitivity and receptor expression
- Blood concentration and binding proteins
- Interactions with other hormones and signaling systems

How it affects other parts:
- Modulate gene expression, enzyme activity, and membrane transport
- Influence growth, metabolism, reproduction, and behavior
- Coordinate responses across multiple organ systems

Explanation:
- Hormones function as chemical messengers that bind to specific receptors on target cells, initiating intracellular signaling cascades that alter cellular activity. They regulate processes like metabolism (insulin/glucagon), growth (growth hormone), reproduction (sex steroids), stress response (cortisol), and water balance (ADH). Hormonal actions can be permissive (enabling other hormones), synergistic (amplifying effects), or antagonistic (opposing effects). The endocrine system provides slow, sustained regulation compared to the rapid neural system, allowing for long-term adaptations to internal and external stimuli.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model hormone-target interactions with dose-response curves
- Implement regulatory networks with feedback and cross-talk
- Simulate physiological responses to hormonal changes
