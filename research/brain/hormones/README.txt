# Hormones

Major subparts:
- types
- function
- endocrine glands
- hormone receptors
- feedback mechanisms

Subparts of endocrine glands:
	- pituitary gland
	- pineal gland
	- thyroid gland
	- adrenal gland
	- pancreas
	- gonads (ovaries/testes)

Functionality:
- Regulate physiological processes, maintain homeostasis, and coordinate body responses to internal and external stimuli

What affects it:
- Environmental factors (stress, diet, light cycles)
- Neural signals from hypothalamus and autonomic nervous system
- Feedback from target tissues and blood hormone levels

How it affects other parts:
- Influence metabolism, growth, reproduction, and stress responses
- Modulate immune function, mood, and cognitive processes
- Coordinate with nervous system for integrated physiological control

Explanation:
- Hormones are chemical messengers produced by endocrine glands and released into the bloodstream to regulate distant target tissues. They act through specific receptors, often with feedback mechanisms to maintain balance. The endocrine system works in concert with the nervous system, providing slower but longer-lasting effects. Hormones can be classified by structure (peptide, steroid, amine) and function (tropic vs. nontropic). The hypothalamic-pituitary axis serves as the master regulator, integrating neural and hormonal signals. Disruptions in hormonal balance can lead to various endocrine disorders affecting multiple organ systems.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model endocrine system as a network of glands with feedback loops
- Implement hormone-receptor interactions for signal transduction
- Simulate homeostatic regulation through negative feedback
