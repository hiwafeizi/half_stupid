# Feedback Mechanisms

Functionality:
- Regulate hormone secretion to maintain homeostasis and prevent over/under-secretion

What affects it:
- Blood levels of hormones and regulated substances
- Sensitivity of feedback sensors
- Time delays in hormone action

How it affects other parts:
- Adjust secretion rates of upstream glands
- Maintain stable internal environment
- Prevent hormone excess or deficiency

Explanation:
- Feedback mechanisms ensure hormonal balance through negative feedback (most common) where high hormone levels inhibit further secretion, and positive feedback (rare) where hormone levels stimulate more release. The hypothalamic-pituitary-target gland axis exemplifies negative feedback: target gland hormones inhibit pituitary tropic hormones and hypothalamic releasing hormones. Long-loop feedback involves direct effects on hypothalamus, while short-loop involves pituitary self-regulation. Feedforward mechanisms anticipate needs. Disruptions cause endocrine disorders like hyper/hypothyroidism.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Implement negative feedback loops with set points
- Model delays and oscillations in hormonal control
- Simulate feedback disruptions and compensatory responses
