# Hormone Receptors

Functionality:
- Bind specific hormones and initiate intracellular signaling to mediate hormonal effects

What affects it:
- Hormone concentration and affinity
- Receptor density and desensitization
- Post-translational modifications

How it affects other parts:
- Transduce extracellular signals into intracellular responses
- Regulate gene expression, metabolism, and cellular function
- Determine tissue-specific responses to hormones

Explanation:
- Hormone receptors are proteins that specifically bind hormones, triggering signal transduction pathways. Membrane receptors (for peptide/amine hormones) use G-proteins, tyrosine kinases, or ion channels to activate second messengers like cAMP, IP3, or calcium. Intracellular receptors (for steroid/thyroid hormones) act as transcription factors, binding DNA to regulate gene expression. Receptor specificity ensures targeted responses, while desensitization and down-regulation prevent overstimulation. Receptor polymorphisms can affect hormone sensitivity, contributing to endocrine disorders.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model receptor-ligand binding with affinity constants
- Implement signal transduction cascades for different receptor types
- Simulate receptor regulation and desensitization
