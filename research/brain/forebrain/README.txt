Functionality:
The forebrain is responsible for higher cognitive functions, sensory processing, voluntary movement, emotion, memory, and decision-making. It integrates information from the environment and internal states to generate complex behaviors and conscious experience.


What affects it:
- Sensory input from the body and environment
- Neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, etc.)
- Hormonal signals (e.g., stress hormones)
- Experience, learning, and plasticity
- Damage (trauma, stroke, neurodegeneration)


How it affects other parts:
- Sends motor commands to the brainstem and spinal cord
- Modulates autonomic and endocrine functions via the hypothalamus
- Influences emotional and motivational states through limbic connections
- Integrates and interprets sensory information for perception and action


Explanation:
- The forebrain, also known as the prosencephalon, is the largest and most anterior part of the brain, comprising about two-thirds of its total mass. It encompasses the cerebrum, which includes the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia; the diencephalon, consisting of the thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus, and subthalamus; the limbic system, involved in emotion and memory; and the olfactory bulb, the primary olfactory processing center. The cerebral cortex is highly convoluted, with gyri and sulci increasing surface area for complex processing. The forebrain integrates sensory information, generates voluntary movements, regulates emotions, forms memories, and enables higher cognitive functions like reasoning, planning, and language. Its layered structure, from primary sensory areas to association cortices, allows hierarchical processing. The forebrain's plasticity enables learning and adaptation throughout life, making it central to human cognition and behavior.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model the forebrain as a set of interacting modules: sensory processing, memory, decision-making, and motor planning.
- Use a central workspace or blackboard architecture to integrate information from different modules.
- Implement learning and plasticity mechanisms (e.g., reinforcement learning, Hebbian learning) to allow adaptation over time.
- Allow the forebrain to arbitrate between competing drives and select actions based on goals and context.
