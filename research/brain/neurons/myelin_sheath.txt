# Myelin Sheath

Functionality:
- Insulates axons to increase conduction velocity and efficiency

What affects it:
- Oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell wrapping
- Lipid composition and compaction
- Demyelinating diseases or toxins

How it affects other parts:
- Speeds neural transmission
- Reduces energy expenditure for ion pumping
- Enables precise timing in neural circuits

Explanation:
- Myelin is a fatty insulating layer produced by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in CNS (myelinate multiple axons), Schwann cells in PNS (myelinate single axons). It forms a multilamellar sheath with gaps (nodes of Ranvier) every 1-2 mm. Action potentials jump between nodes via saltatory conduction, increasing speed 10-100 fold. Myelin also prevents ion leakage, reducing metabolic cost. Demyelination in multiple sclerosis slows conduction, causing neurological symptoms. Myelin thickness correlates with axon diameter and conduction speed.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model saltatory conduction with discrete nodes
- Implement myelination effects on propagation speed
- Simulate demyelination and conduction failures
