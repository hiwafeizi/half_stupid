# Sensory Neurons

Functionality:
- Detect and transmit sensory information from periphery to CNS

What affects it:
- Stimulus modality (touch, pain, temperature, etc.)
- Receptor sensitivity and adaptation
- Axonal conduction properties

How it affects other parts:
- Relay sensory data to spinal cord and brain
- Initiate reflex arcs
- Contribute to perception and awareness

Explanation:
- Sensory neurons are pseudounipolar, with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (somatic) or cranial ganglia (visceral). They have specialized receptors: mechanoreceptors for touch/pressure, nociceptors for pain, thermoreceptors for temperature, chemoreceptors for taste/smell. Sensory transduction converts physical/chemical stimuli into electrical signals. Myelinated A-fibers conduct fast (touch, proprioception), unmyelinated C-fibers conduct slow (pain, temperature). Sensory neurons adapt to constant stimuli, allowing detection of changes. They form the afferent limb of reflexes and conscious sensation.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model sensory transduction for different modalities
- Implement adaptation and threshold mechanisms
- Simulate sensory pathways and reflex responses
