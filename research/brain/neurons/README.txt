# Neurons

Major subparts:
- types (sensory, motor, interneurons)
- function
- neurotransmitters
- synapses
- axon
- dendrite
- soma (cell body)
- myelin sheath

Functionality:
- Transmit electrical and chemical signals to process and integrate information

What affects it:
- Synaptic inputs from other neurons
- Neurotransmitter levels and receptor activity
- Ion channel function and membrane potential
- Metabolic state and oxygen supply

How it affects other parts:
- Generate action potentials to communicate with other neurons
- Release neurotransmitters to modulate target cells
- Form neural circuits for perception, cognition, and behavior

Explanation:
- Neurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system, specialized for information processing and transmission. They consist of a cell body (soma) containing the nucleus, dendrites for receiving signals, and an axon for sending signals. Neurons communicate via synapses, where electrical signals trigger neurotransmitter release. Different types serve specific functions: sensory neurons detect stimuli, motor neurons control effectors, and interneurons integrate information. The neuron's ability to integrate thousands of inputs and generate all-or-none action potentials enables complex computation. Myelination speeds conduction, and synaptic plasticity underlies learning and memory.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model neurons as integrate-and-fire units
- Implement synaptic transmission and plasticity
- Simulate neural networks for information processing
