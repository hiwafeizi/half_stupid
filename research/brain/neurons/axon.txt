# Axon

Functionality:
- Conducts action potentials from soma to synaptic terminals

What affects it:
- Myelination for conduction speed
- Diameter and length
- Ion channel distribution

How it affects other parts:
- Transmits signals to distant targets
- Enables long-range neural communication
- Influences synaptic efficacy and timing

Explanation:
- The axon is a long, thin extension from the soma, specialized for impulse conduction. Action potentials propagate via saltatory conduction in myelinated axons (jumping between nodes of Ranvier), reaching speeds up to 100 m/s. Unmyelinated axons conduct slower (0.5-10 m/s). The axon hillock integrates inputs, and the terminal bouton contains synaptic vesicles. Axonal transport moves materials bidirectionally: anterograde for neurotransmitters, retrograde for trophic factors. Axon damage causes Wallerian degeneration, with potential regeneration in PNS but limited in CNS.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model action potential propagation with cable theory
- Implement myelination effects on conduction velocity
- Simulate axonal transport and degeneration
