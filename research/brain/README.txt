# Brain Folder Overview

This folder contains research notes, structure, and subparts for all major regions of the brain, organized for reference and further exploration. Each subfolder corresponds to a major brain region or system, with files for each key subpart.

## Major Regions and Systems

- **Forebrain**: cerebrum, diencephalon, limbic system, olfactory bulb
- **Midbrain**: tectum, tegmentum, colliculi, substantia nigra, red nucleus, periaqueductal gray
- **Hindbrain**: pons, medulla oblongata, reticular formation, cerebellum
- **Cerebellum**: cortex layers, deep nuclei, arbor vitae, peduncles
- **Spinal Cord**: segments, horns, central canal
- **Neurons**: types, structure, neurotransmitters, synapses
- **Hormones**: types, glands, receptors, feedback
- **Sensory System**: vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell, proprioception, balance

Each region's README lists its subparts and the folder contains a file for each, ready for detailed notes or research.
