# Coccygeal Segment

Notes and research on the coccygeal segment of the spinal cord.


Functionality:
The coccygeal segment is the lowest part of the spinal cord, involved in sensory and motor control of the tailbone area.


What affects it:
- Input from the brain and peripheral nerves
- Sensory feedback from the coccyx region
- Injury or disease (rare)


How it affects other parts:
- Influences sensation and movement in the tailbone area
- Loss of function has minimal impact in humans


Explanation:
The coccygeal segment (Co1) is a small, vestigial part of the spinal cord. It serves the skin over the coccyx and has limited function in humans.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model as a minimal node for completeness.
