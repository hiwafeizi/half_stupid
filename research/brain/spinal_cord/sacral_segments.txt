# Sacral Segments

Notes and research on sacral segments of the spinal cord.


Functionality:
The sacral segments control pelvic organs, lower limb muscles, and contribute to bowel, bladder, and sexual function.


What affects it:
- Input from the brain and peripheral nerves
- Sensory feedback from pelvic region
- Autonomic (parasympathetic) signals
- Injury or disease (e.g., spinal cord injury, spina bifida)


How it affects other parts:
- Regulates urination, defecation, and sexual reflexes
- Influences lower limb movement and posture
- Loss of function can cause incontinence or paralysis


Explanation:
The sacral spinal cord (S1-S5) is the lowest section, serving the pelvis and lower limbs. It is crucial for autonomic and somatic control of pelvic organs and lower extremities.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model sacral segments as nodes for pelvic and lower limb control.
- Simulate autonomic reflexes for bladder and bowel function.
