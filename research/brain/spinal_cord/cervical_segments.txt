# Cervical Segments

Notes and research on cervical segments of the spinal cord.


Functionality:
The cervical segments control neck, shoulder, arm, and hand muscles, and receive sensory input from these regions. They are essential for upper limb movement and sensation.


What affects it:
- Input from the brain and peripheral nerves
- Sensory feedback from the upper limbs
- Injury or disease (e.g., cervical spinal cord injury)


How it affects other parts:
- Regulates arm and hand movement and sensation
- Loss of function leads to weakness or paralysis of the upper limbs


Explanation:
There are 8 cervical segments (C1-C8) in the spinal cord. They serve as relay points for motor and sensory information to and from the upper limbs and neck.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model cervical segments as nodes relaying signals between brain and upper limbs.
- Simulate arm and hand movement and sensation.
