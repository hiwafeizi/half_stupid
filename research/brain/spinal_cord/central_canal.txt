# Central Canal

Notes and research on the central canal of the spinal cord.


Functionality:
The central canal is a small, fluid-filled channel running through the spinal cord, containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).


What affects it:
- CSF production and flow
- Blockage or abnormal dilation (syringomyelia)


How it affects other parts:
- Helps maintain spinal cord homeostasis
- Blockage can cause neurological symptoms


Explanation:
The central canal is lined with ependymal cells and is continuous with the brain's ventricular system. It plays a minor role in adult humans but is important in development and some diseases.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model as a passive structure for completeness.
