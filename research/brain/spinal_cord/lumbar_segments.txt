# Lumbar Segments

Notes and research on lumbar segments of the spinal cord.


Functionality:
The lumbar segments control lower limb muscles and receive sensory input from the legs and lower back. They are essential for walking and posture.


What affects it:
- Input from the brain and peripheral nerves
- Sensory feedback from the legs
- Injury or disease (e.g., lumbar spinal cord injury)


How it affects other parts:
- Regulates leg movement and posture
- Loss of function leads to weakness or paralysis of the legs


Explanation:
There are 5 lumbar segments (L1-L5) in the spinal cord. They serve as relay points for motor and sensory information to and from the lower limbs.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model lumbar segments as nodes relaying signals between brain and legs.
- Simulate walking and posture control.
