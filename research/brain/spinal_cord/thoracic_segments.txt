# Thoracic Segments

Notes and research on thoracic segments of the spinal cord.


Functionality:
The thoracic segments of the spinal cord control trunk muscles and receive sensory input from the torso. They also contain sympathetic autonomic neurons.


What affects it:
- Input from the brain and peripheral nerves
- Sensory feedback from the trunk
- Autonomic signals (sympathetic nervous system)
- Injury or disease (e.g., spinal cord injury)


How it affects other parts:
- Regulates posture and trunk stability
- Influences autonomic functions (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure)
- Loss of function can impair breathing and core stability


Explanation:
There are 12 thoracic segments (T1-T12) in the spinal cord. They serve as relay points for motor and sensory information to and from the trunk and internal organs. They are also important for autonomic (sympathetic) outflow.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model thoracic segments as nodes relaying signals between brain, trunk muscles, and organs.
- Simulate autonomic output for physiological regulation.
