# Spinal Cord

Major subparts:
- cervical segments
- thoracic segments
- lumbar segments
- sacral segments
- coccygeal segment
- dorsal horn
- ventral horn
- central canal

Add more subsections as needed.


Functionality:
The spinal cord transmits sensory and motor signals between the body and brain, coordinates reflexes, and supports basic locomotion and posture.


What affects it:
- Input from the brain (descending motor commands)
- Sensory input from the body
- Local spinal circuits and interneurons
- Injury or disease (e.g., spinal cord injury, infection)


How it affects other parts:
- Relays information to and from the brain
- Controls reflexes and basic movement patterns
- Loss of function leads to paralysis, sensory loss, or autonomic dysfunction


Explanation:
The spinal cord is a long, thin bundle of nervous tissue running from the brainstem to the lower back. It is organized into segments, each serving a specific body region. It is essential for rapid, automatic responses (reflexes) and as a conduit for voluntary movement.


Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model the spinal cord as a series of segments, each with sensory and motor pathways.
- Implement reflex arcs as local circuits.
- Allow for simulation of injury by blocking or altering signal transmission.
