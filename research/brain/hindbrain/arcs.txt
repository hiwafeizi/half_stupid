# Arcs (Arcuate Nucleus)

Functionality:
- Involved in regulating feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, and hormone release

What affects it:
- Nutrient levels (glucose, leptin, ghrelin)
- Hormonal signals from periphery
- Neural inputs from hypothalamus and brainstem

How it affects other parts:
- Releases neuropeptides to control appetite and metabolism
- Influences pituitary gland via hypophyseal portal system
- Modulates autonomic nervous system for energy balance

Explanation:
- The arcuate nucleus is a small cluster of neurons in the hypothalamus (though sometimes associated with hindbrain functions), located at the base of the third ventricle. It acts as a key integrator of peripheral signals about energy status, receiving inputs from hormones like leptin (satiety) and ghrelin (hunger). The nucleus contains two main populations: orexigenic neurons (NPY/AgRP) that promote feeding, and anorexigenic neurons (POMC/CART) that suppress appetite. These neurons project to other hypothalamic areas and the pituitary, regulating food intake, energy expenditure, and hormone secretion. Dysfunction contributes to obesity and metabolic disorders.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model as an energy balance regulator
- Implement hunger/satiety signals based on nutrient status
- Simulate hormonal feedback loops for appetite control
