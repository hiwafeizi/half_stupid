# Balance (Vestibular) System

Functionality:
- Detects head movement and position for balance, posture, and spatial orientation

What affects it:
- Head acceleration and tilt via semicircular canals and otolith organs
- Visual and proprioceptive input for multisensory integration
- Central processing in brainstem and cerebellum

How it affects other parts:
- Controls eye movements (VOR) and posture
- Influences autonomic responses and spatial awareness
- Contributes to motion sickness and vertigo

Explanation:
- The vestibular system in the inner ear includes semicircular canals (angular acceleration) and otolith organs (linear acceleration/gravity). Hair cells transduce movement into neural signals via vestibular nerve to vestibular nuclei, cerebellum, and cortex. The vestibulo-ocular reflex stabilizes gaze during head movement. Balance integrates vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive cues. Dysfunction causes vertigo, nystagmus, and imbalance. The system adapts to repeated stimuli, enabling habituation.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model canal and otolith dynamics
- Implement VOR and postural control
- Simulate motion sickness and adaptation
