# Optic Nerve

Functionality:
- Transmits visual information from retina to brain

What affects it:
- Retinal ganglion cell activity
- Myelination and conduction velocity
- Glaucomatous pressure or trauma

How it affects other parts:
- Relays visual signals to thalamus and midbrain
- Enables conscious vision and reflexive eye movements
- Damage causes visual field deficits

Explanation:
- The optic nerve consists of ~1.2 million axons from retinal ganglion cells, exiting the eye at the optic disc. It travels through the orbit, optic canal, and chiasm where nasal fibers cross. Post-chiasm, it forms optic tracts to lateral geniculate nucleus (vision) and superior colliculus (reflexes). The nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes, allowing fast conduction. It lacks regeneration capacity; damage causes permanent vision loss. The optic nerve head is visible during eye exams, revealing conditions like papilledema.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model fiber crossing at optic chiasm
- Implement visual field mapping
- Simulate conduction and damage effects
