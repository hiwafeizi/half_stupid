# Auditory Nerve

Functionality:
- Transmits auditory signals from cochlea to brainstem for initial processing

What affects it:
- Cochlear hair cell activity and synchronization
- Myelination and conduction velocity
- Acoustic neuroma or ototoxic drugs

How it affects other parts:
- Relays frequency and timing information to cochlear nucleus
- Enables sound localization and pattern recognition
- Damage causes sensorineural hearing loss

Explanation:
- The auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII) consists of ~30,000 axons from spiral ganglion neurons, divided into vestibular (balance) and cochlear portions. Cochlear fibers are myelinated, conducting action potentials at 5-100 m/s depending on diameter. They preserve temporal precision for phase locking (up to 5 kHz). The nerve terminates in cochlear nucleus, where processing begins for frequency, intensity, and timing. Auditory nerve fibers show spontaneous activity and adaptation. Tumors or degeneration cause tinnitus and hearing loss.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model fiber conduction and temporal precision
- Implement phase locking for pitch perception
- Simulate nerve damage and hearing loss
