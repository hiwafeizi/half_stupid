# Sensory System

Major subparts:
- vision (visual system)
- hearing (auditory system)
- touch (somatosensory system)
- taste (gustatory system)
- smell (olfactory system)
- proprioception
- balance (vestibular system)

Subparts of vision:
	- retina
	- optic nerve
	- visual cortex

Subparts of hearing:
	- cochlea
	- auditory nerve
	- auditory cortex

Subparts of touch:
	- mechanoreceptors
	- thermoreceptors
	- nociceptors

Functionality:
- Detect and process environmental stimuli for perception and behavioral responses

What affects it:
- Stimulus intensity, quality, and location
- Sensory adaptation and attention
- Central modulation and expectation

How it affects other parts:
- Provides input to motor systems for reflexes and voluntary actions
- Influences emotional and cognitive processing
- Shapes perception and awareness

Explanation:
- The sensory system comprises specialized receptors and neural pathways that transduce physical stimuli into neural signals. Each modality has dedicated receptors: photoreceptors for light, mechanoreceptors for touch/pressure, chemoreceptors for taste/smell, nociceptors for pain, thermoreceptors for temperature. Sensory information is relayed through peripheral nerves to brainstem, thalamus, and cortex. The system exhibits hierarchical processing: peripheral receptors detect stimuli, subcortical structures process basic features, cortical areas enable complex perception. Sensory systems interact, enabling multisensory integration for coherent perception.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model sensory transduction and receptor dynamics
- Implement hierarchical processing from periphery to cortex
- Simulate multisensory integration and attention
