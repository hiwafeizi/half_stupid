# Thermoreceptors

Functionality:
- Detect temperature changes for thermal sensation and homeostasis

What affects it:
- Temperature deviation from skin baseline
- Receptor sensitivity to warm/cold
- Central modulation and adaptation

How it affects other parts:
- Trigger thermoregulatory responses
- Contribute to pain perception at extremes
- Influence comfort and behavioral adjustments

Explanation:
- Thermoreceptors are free nerve endings in skin and mucous membranes, divided into warm (TRPV1-like) and cold (TRPM8-like) receptors. They respond to temperature changes, not absolute values, with dynamic ranges. Warm receptors activate above 30°C, cold below 25°C. Signals travel via C-fibers to spinothalamic tract and thalamus. Thermoreceptors enable thermal discrimination and drive behaviors like seeking warmth or cooling. They interact with nociceptors for burning/freezing pain.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model temperature thresholds and adaptation
- Implement warm/cold discrimination
- Simulate thermoregulatory feedback
