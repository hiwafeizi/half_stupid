# Touch System

Functionality:
- Detects tactile stimuli for texture, pressure, vibration, and object manipulation

What affects it:
- Mechanical deformation of skin and receptors
- Receptor density and innervation
- Central processing and attention

How it affects other parts:
- Provides feedback for motor control and grasping
- Contributes to body awareness and pain perception
- Influences social touch and emotional bonding

Explanation:
- The somatosensory system includes mechanoreceptors (Merkel, Meissner, Pacini, Ruffini), nociceptors, and thermoreceptors in skin, muscles, and joints. Signals travel via dorsal root ganglia to dorsal column-medial lemniscus (fine touch) or spinothalamic tract (pain/temperature) to thalamus and somatosensory cortex. The cortex has somatotopic organization (homunculus). Touch processing involves texture discrimination, two-point threshold, and haptic perception. The system enables dexterous manipulation and social communication through touch.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model receptor types and adaptation
- Implement somatotopic mapping
- Simulate haptic feedback and object recognition
