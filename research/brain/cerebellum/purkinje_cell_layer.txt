# Purkinje Cell Layer

Functionality:
- Main output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, providing inhibitory (GABAergic) signals to the deep cerebellar nuclei
- Integrate inputs from parallel fibers (granule cells) and climbing fibers (inferior olive)

What affects it:
- Synaptic input from granule and climbing fibers
- Neurotransmitter levels (especially GABA and glutamate)
- Genetic and developmental factors
- Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., spinocerebellar ataxia)

How it affects other parts:
- Inhibits deep cerebellar nuclei, shaping cerebellar output
- Modulates timing and precision of motor commands

Explanation:
- Purkinje cells are the principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex, located in a single layer between the molecular and granular layers. Each Purkinje cell receives thousands of excitatory inputs from parallel fibers (from granule cells) and a single powerful climbing fiber input from the inferior olive. This dual input system allows for complex integration: parallel fibers provide contextual information about ongoing movements, while climbing fibers signal errors or unexpected events. Purkinje cells release GABA, inhibiting the deep cerebellar nuclei. Long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber synapses and long-term potentiation (LTP) at climbing fiber synapses enable motor learning. Degeneration of Purkinje cells, as seen in cerebellar ataxias, leads to severe motor coordination deficits.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model Purkinje cells as inhibitory units receiving two types of input (parallel and climbing fibers)
- Implement learning rules (e.g., LTD/LTP) for synaptic plasticity
- Output from Purkinje cells should modulate deep nuclei activity
