# Red Nucleus

Functionality:
- Coordinates voluntary movements, particularly of the upper limbs and hands

What affects it:
- Cortical motor commands
- Cerebellar input for coordination
- Sensory feedback

How it affects other parts:
- Sends motor signals to spinal cord via rubrospinal tract
- Influences muscle tone and precision movements
- Modulates reflex responses

Explanation:
- The red nucleus, named for its iron-rich pigmentation, is a motor control center in the tegmentum. It receives input from the motor cortex and cerebellum, integrating voluntary commands with sensory feedback. The magnocellular part projects to the spinal cord, controlling distal limb movements like reaching and grasping. The parvocellular part connects to the inferior olive for cerebellar learning. The red nucleus is part of the extrapyramidal system, complementing corticospinal pathways for skilled motor control.

Implementation suggestions (code):
- Model limb movement coordination
- Implement cerebellar-red nucleus interactions
- Simulate precision motor control
