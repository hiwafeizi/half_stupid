### **Origin: The First Groups**

The world begins by creating creatures in small groups of ten.
They start with no knowledge at all, only simple drives like hunger, safety, curiosity, exploration, and the instinct to stay near familiar creatures.
Nothing else is designed or programmed.
Whether they survive or disappear is determined entirely by their own behavior and natural selection.

**Rules of the first-groups scenario:**

1. Creatures appear in small groups of ten with no built-in knowledge.
2. They have only basic drives such as hunger, safety, curiosity, and simple group attachment.
3. They do not understand food, danger, or shelter — they learn only through experience.
4. Most early groups fail, but those that survive pass on their traits.
5. Slight genetic differences allow evolution to shape behavior over generations.
6. No social rules are programmed; any cooperation emerges naturally if it helps survival.
7. Groups that accidentally stay together gain small advantages, which evolution may reinforce.
8. Over many generations, creatures gradually become capable of stable survival.
9. Once a population becomes consistently self-sufficient, they form the foundation for early “people” capable of exploring the world further.

Everything beyond these rules is left to emerge naturally — group behavior, social tendencies, curiosity levels, survival strategies, and the first signs of early culture.
