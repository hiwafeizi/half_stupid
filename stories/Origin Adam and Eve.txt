### **Origin: Adam and Eve**

The project begins with two agents placed in a small paradise.
They start with no knowledge, only basic drives like hunger, safety, curiosity, exploration, and simple social bonding.
They can raise offspring and gradually form a small community.

**Rules of the origin scenario:**

1. Two agents begin in a protected paradise with stable resources.
2. They have basic drives and no built-in knowledge.
3. Offspring start with no knowledge but learn from their own experience.
4. Parents provide simple care and protection for their children.
5. A **temple** exists in the center of paradise as an ancient, unexplained structure.
6. The temple occasionally provides basic supplies, creating early positive meaning.
7. The temple contains a **hidden maze** that only the most curious agents will explore deeply.
8. At the end of the maze, the agent faces an **intentional choice**:
   * **destroy the temple**
   * **leave peacefully and return to normal life**
9. Destroying the temple releases powerful benefits or unlocks new areas, but the agent does not know this beforehand.
10. The paradise contains a **hidden exit door** that opens only when a curious agent discovers it.
11. The door stays open **for a very short time**.
12. Other agents can follow **only if they happen to be close enough and move quickly**.
13. After the brief moment, the door closes again, and the remaining agents must rediscover the exit on their own.

Everything beyond these rules is left to emerge naturally — how they interpret the temple, how they view those who leave, and what meaning or mythology grows across generations.
