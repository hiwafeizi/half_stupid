### **Origin: Adam and Eve**

The project begins with two agents placed in a small paradise.
They start with no knowledge, only basic drives like hunger, safety, curiosity, and bonding.
They can reproduce, care for their offspring, and slowly grow a small community.


**Rules of the origin scenario:**

1. Two agents begin in a protected paradise with stable resources.
2. They have basic drives and no built-in knowledge.
3. They can bond and reproduce when conditions are safe.
4. Parents provide basic care for their children.
5. Offspring start with no knowledge but can learn from experience.
6. The paradise has one or more hidden “exit buttons”.
7. Agents can leave paradise only if their curiosity drive becomes strong enough to explore and discover the exit.
8. Once an agent finds the way out, the larger world becomes accessible.

Everything beyond these rules is left to emerge naturally.
